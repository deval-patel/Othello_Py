**How to play the game**
The goal of this game is to have as many of your own type of tokens as possible. 

When it is your turn, you can place a token on the board to capture one or more of the other player's token by clicking the board. The way you capture the tokens is like making a sandwich, we want our sandwich to be filled with the other player's tokens with no empty spaces in between. 

For example, for a player X, to make a successful move, 
let's examine two pictures. 

The picture below is the state of the game at the beginning, 
when the game has just been started.

Now, Let's see what happens if Player X, places a token below
the bottom-left "O" Token. 

![Post Move:](/images/postMove.jpg)

Then, this new "X" token placed will sandwich the previous "O" token, making it an "X" token!

Player X, will go first, followed by Player 0. They will 
alternate turns as they play the game. If a player can not 
make a successful move, then it will go to the other player's
turn. In addition to this, if neither player can make a turn,
the game will end. 

When the game ends, the winner is determined by going back
to the goal of the game. Whichever player has the most tokens
will win.
